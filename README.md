## Data-oriented python examples and tutorial
This repository hosts a bunch of examples of data oriented Python programming and it hosts the code
for a beginner tutorial in data oriented python.

Everything works with batect, so...


### Getting Started
Just fire up batect via ```./batect --list-tasks``` or launch straight into
```./batect dev``` to open up a Jupyter notebook server.

### Tutorial
To follow along with the tutorial, fire up the notebook server and open up work/DO-Tutorial.ipynb.
